            <h2 class="interactive-title">Cat Diets by Age</h2>
            <div class="expandable-content">
                <p>Cats have different dietary needs at various stages of their lives:</p>
                <ul class="first-word-bold">
                    <li><span class="bold-word">Kittens (0-6 months): </span> Require a diet rich in protein and calories for growth. Typically, feed them high-quality kitten-specific wet or dry cat food formulated to meet their nutritional needs. A general guideline is to provide 3-4 meals per day, with approximately 1/4 to 1/3 cup of dry cat food per meal, supplemented with one to two 3-ounce cans of wet cat food per day.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-word">Adult Cats (7 months - 6 years):</span> Require a well-balanced diet, which typically includes a combination of high-quality wet and dry cat food. A general guideline is to feed an adult cat around 1/2 to 1 cup of dry cat food per day, supplemented with one to two 3-ounce cans of wet cat food.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-word">Mature Cats (7-10 years):</span> Require a balanced diet that supports their maintenance needs, with slightly reduced calorie intake compared to their adult years. Typically, provide around 1/3 to 1/2 cup of high-quality dry cat food per day, along with one to two 3-ounce cans of wet cat food.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-word">Senior Cats (11-14 years):</span> Benefit from a diet tailored to their age, often including specially formulated senior cat food with added nutrients to support joint and dental health. Typically, provide around 1/4 to 1/3 cup of high-quality dry cat food per day, supplemented with one to two 3-ounce cans of wet cat food.  These added nutrients can help maintain their overall health and comfort in their senior years.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-word">Super Senior Cats (15+ years):</span> Require a specialized diet formulated to meet their specific needs in their advanced years. Choose senior cat food with added nutrients to support joint, dental, and overall health. Typically, provide around 1/4 to 1/3 cup of high-quality dry cat food per day, supplemented with one to two 3-ounce cans of wet cat food. Adjust the portions based on your cat's specific age, weight, and activity level. These added nutrients can contribute to their comfort and well-being in their golden years. Regular vet check-ups become even more important to address age-related health concerns.</li>

            <h2 class="interactive-title">Human Foods Safe for Cats</h2>
            <div class="expandable-content">
                <p>While cats primarily need cat food, some human foods are safe for occasional treats:</p>
                <ul class="first-word-bold">
                    <li><span class="bold-word">Cooked Chicken or Turkey:</span> Plain, boneless, and skinless meat is a favorite among many cats.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-word">Cooked Fish:</span> Salmon and tuna, without added seasonings or spices, are occasional treats.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-word">Carrots:</span> Cooked or steamed carrots can be a healthy snack, but cats are obligate carnivores and don't require vegetables in their diet.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-word">Cooked Eggs:</span> Plain scrambled or boiled eggs can provide a protein boost.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-word">Plain Rice:</span> Plain, cooked white or brown rice may be offered in small amounts.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-word">Cooked Oatmeal:</span> Plain oatmeal, cooked with water and no added sugar, can be a source of fiber.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-word">Pumpkin:</span> Canned, unsweetened pumpkin (not pumpkin pie filling) can aid digestion.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-word">Cantaloupe:</span> Small amounts of fresh cantaloupe are safe as an occasional treat.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-word">Blueberries:</span> A few fresh, washed blueberries can serve as a healthy treat.</li>

                    <li><span class="bold-word">Chocolate:</span> Contains theobromine and caffeine, which are toxic to cats and can cause vomiting, diarrhea, seizures, and even death.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-word">Grapes</span> and Raisins: Can lead to kidney failure in cats, with even small amounts causing severe issues.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-word">Onions and Garlic:</span> Contain compounds that can damage a cat's red blood cells, leading to anemia</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-word">Alcohol:</span> Even small amounts of alcohol can be extremely toxic and potentially fatal to cats.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-word">Caffeine:</span> Found in coffee, tea, and some energy drinks, caffeine can cause rapid heart rate, restlessness, and tremors in cats.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-word">Bones:</span> Cooked bones can splinter and cause choking or internal injuries in cats.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-word">Xylitol:</span> A sugar substitute found in many sugar-free products like gum and candy, xylitol can lead to insulin release, causing hypoglycemia and liver damage.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-word">Raw Meat and Fish:</span> May contain harmful bacteria like Salmonella and E. coli, and can lead to nutritional imbalances over time.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-word">Dairy Products:</span> While many cats are lactose intolerant and can develop digestive issues from milk and dairy products.</li>
                    <li><span class="bold-word">Avocado:</span> Contains a substance called persin, which is toxic to cats and can cause gastrointestinal problems.</li>
