By the early 20th century, Siamese cats were recognized as a distinct breed in the Western world. Over the years, selective breeding has refined their striking appearance and unique color patterns while maintaining their sociable and vocal nature. Today, Siamese cats continue to be adored for their beauty and engaging personalities, making them a beloved breed worldwide.</p>
